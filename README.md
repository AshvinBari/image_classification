# CLIP Image Classification

This project demonstrates how to use OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model to classify images based on possible text descriptions. The model compares the input image with several possible descriptions and predicts the most likely match.

## Model Used

This project utilizes the `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32` model from Hugging Face. This model is a Vision Transformer (ViT) variant that is pre-trained on various image-text pairs. It is capable of understanding and relating images to their textual descriptions, making it suitable for tasks like image classification and zero-shot learning.

## Features
- Load and process images with the CLIP model using the `CLIPProcessor` and `CLIPModel`.
- Classify images based on similarity between image and text embeddings.
- Supports multiple possible text descriptions.

## Requirements

To get started, you'll need the following libraries:

- `torch`: PyTorch for running the model.
- `transformers`: Hugging Face's Transformers library to use the CLIP model.
- `Pillow`: For image loading and processing.

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install torch transformers Pillow 
```
